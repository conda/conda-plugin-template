# Conda Plugin Tutorials: Subcommands: Rust

In this tutorial, we will create a new conda subcommand written in Rust that multiplies two integers.

To follow along with this guide, make sure you have the latest conda, conda-build, and pip installed:

```bash
(base) $ conda update conda conda-build pip
```

It is also recommended to get familiar with the [`pyo3` project][pyo3] by checking out their [documentation][pyo3 docs].

## Project directory structure

Set up your working directory and files as shown below (or create a new repository using this [template][template]):

```
rust/
â”œâ”€â”€ recipe/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ meta.yaml
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lib.rs
â”œâ”€â”€ rust_plugin.py
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€ pyproject.toml (or setup.py)
```

## Implementing the Rust side of the subcommand plugin

Annotations (e.g., `#[pyfunction]` and `#[pymodule]`) available via [`pyo3`][pyo3] are utilized in the Rust program in order to enable it to be importable by the Python module:

```rust
// src/lib.rs
use pyo3::prelude::*;

#[pyfunction]
// The original function is below
fn multiply(a: isize, b: isize) -> isize {
    a * b
}

#[pymodule]
fn rustiply(_py: Python, m: &PyModule) -> PyResult<()> {
    m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(multiply, m)?)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Once the Rust program is set up as shown in the example above, the Python module (`rust_plugin.py`, shown in the next section) that registers the subcommand via the plugin hook can import the Rust program successfully.

## The custom subcommand module (the Python side of the subcommand plugin)

The `rust_plugin.py` module in this example imports the `rustiply` function from `src.lib.rs` and calls it inside of the function `conda_rustiply()` (where two numbers multiplied) and then registers `conda_rustiply()` via the plugin manager hook called `conda_subcommands` using the `@conda.plugins.hookimpl` decorator:

```python
# rust_plugin.py

import argparse

import rustiply

import conda.plugins


def conda_rustiply(argv: list):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser("conda multiply")
    parser.add_argument("x", type=int, help="First number to multiply")
    parser.add_argument("y", type=int, help="Second number to multiply")

    args = parser.parse_args(argv)
    
    x = args.x
    y = args.y
    result = rustiply.multiply(x, y)
    print(f"\nThe product of {x} * {y} is: {result}\n")


@conda.plugins.hookimpl
def conda_subcommands():
    yield conda.plugins.CondaSubcommand(
        name="multiply",
        summary="A subcommand written in Rust that multiplies two integers",
        action=conda_rustiply,
    )
```

## Packaging the custom subcommand using `pyproject.toml`

In order to install the `conda multiply` subcommand, we will need to configure a Python build system. You can either use the [PEP 621][pep 621]-compliant `pyproject.toml` or alternatively `setup.py` can be used (not shown in this tutorial).

Since [Maturin][maturin] is a dependency, it will need to be listed in the `pyproject.toml` file under the `[project]` section:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0", "setuptools-scm"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "multiply"
version = "1.0"
description = "A subcommand that multiplies two integers"
requires-python = ">=3.7"
dependencies = ["conda", "maturin"]

[tools.setuptools]
py_modules=["multiply"]

[project.entry-points.conda]
multiply = "rust_plugin"
```

<details>
<summary><code>pyproject.toml details</code></summary>

> #### `[build-system]`
> - `requires` This is a list of requirement specifiers for build-time dependencies of a package.
> - `build-backend` Build backends have the ability to accept configuration settings, which can change the way that the package building is handled.
> 
> #### `[project]`
> * `name` (required) This is the name of the package that contains your subcommand. This is also how others will find your subcommand package if you choose to upload it to PyPI.
> * `version` (required) The version of the project; can be specified *either* statically or listed as dynamic.
> `description` A brief description of the project.
> * `requires-python` The version(s) of Python required by your project.
> * `dependencies` These are all of the dependencies for your project. This specific subcommand example requires both `conda` and `maturin`, which is why they are both listed here.
>
> For more information on `pyproject.toml` see the [PyPA packaging documentation][pyproject.toml docs].

</details>


> **Note**
> For more information about entry points specification in general, please read [PyPA's entrypoints documentation][entrypoints docs].

### Development/editable install

The custom `multiply` subcommand plugin can be installed as an editable install by running the following from the directory where `pyproject.toml` is located:

```bash
$ pip install -e .
```

This creates an [editable installation][editable install doc], which enables changes to be made to the `rust_plugin.py` file and have changes be reflected without needing to re-install the module.

After running the above, make sure to run:

```bash
$ maturin develop
```

This command builds the Rust crate and installs it as a Python module directly in your environment for local development. For more information on the `maturin develop` command, please read the [corresponding documentation][maturin develop docs].

### Packaging the custom subcommand using `conda-build`

When you're ready to distribute your custom `multiply` subcommand plugin, you can package it as a conda package:

<details>
<summary><code>recipe/meta.yaml</code></summary>

```yaml
package:
  name: multiply
  version: 1.0

source:
  path: ../

build:
  script: $PYTHON -m pip install --no-deps .

requirements:
  host:
    - python >=3.7

  run:
    - conda
    - python >=3.7
    - maturin

about:
  home: https://github.com/conda/conda-plugin-template/subcommand_plugin_examples/rust_subcommand_plugin_tutorial/multiply
  license: BSD-3-Clause
  license_file: LICENSE
  summary: A subcommand written in Rust that multiplies two integers
```

</details>

```bash
$ conda build ./recipe
```

There is more detailed information available via the [`conda-build` documentation][build conda packages] on how to build conda packages from scratch. Please also check out [this documentation page][upload to anaconda.org] if you'd like to learn how to upload your subcommand package to [anaconda.org][anaconda.org site].

## The subcommand output

Once the subcommand plugin is successfully installed or registered, the help text will display it as an additional option available from other packages:

```bash
$ conda --help
usage: conda [-h] [-V] command ...

conda is a tool for managing and deploying applications, environments and packages.

Options:

positional arguments:
command
   clean        Remove unused packages and caches.

[...output shortened...]

conda commands available from other packages:
multiply - A subcommand written in Rust that multiplies two integers

conda commands available from other packages (legacy):
content-trust
env
```

Running `conda multiply [two integers]` will result in the following output:

```bash
$ conda multiply 5 4

The product of 5 * 4 is: 20
```

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You've successfully implemented a conda subcommand plugin written in Rust! For further reference on how the plugin system works, check out the [official `pluggy` docs][pluggy docs].
