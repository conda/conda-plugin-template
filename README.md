This repository contains a mix of templates and tutorials related to conda plugins.


## Tutorials

To take a look at the tutorials, head over to [tutorials](./tutorials).


## Templates

We currently have a [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.io) template you can use to
start a new conda plugin project. To use it, run the following command:

```
cookiecutter gh:conda/conda-plugin-template --directory="cookiecutter-template"
```

or

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/conda/conda-plugin-template.git --directory="cookiecutter-template"
```

If you do not currently have cookiecutter installed, please refer to their 
[installation guide](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html).
