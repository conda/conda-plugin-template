# Custom Subcommand Plugin Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will create a new `conda` subcommand that takes an input of three coordinates and prints out an ASCII graph.

To follow along with this guide make sure you have the latest conda and conda-build installed:

```bash
(base) $ conda update conda conda-build
```

## Project directory structure

Set up your working directory and files as shown below (or create a new repo using this [template][template]):

```
conda-plugin-template/
├── recipe/
│   └── meta.yaml
├── ascii_graph.py
└── pyproject.toml (or setup.py)
```

## The custom subcommand module

The following module implements a function, `ascii_graph` (where a set of three numbers gets converted into an ascii graph), and registers it with the plugin manager hook called `conda_subcommands` using the `@conda.plugins.register` decorator.

```python
# ascii_graph.py

from sympy import symbols
from sympy.plotting import textplot

import argparse
import conda.plugins


def ascii_graph(argv: list):
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser("conda ascii-graph")

    parser.add_argument("x", type=float, help="First coordinate to graph")
    parser.add_argument("y", type=float, help="Second coordinate to graph")
    parser.add_argument("z", type=float, help="Third coordinate to graph")

    args = parser.parse_args(argv)

    s = symbols('s')
    textplot(s**args.x,args.y,args.z)


@conda.plugins.register
def conda_subcommands():
    yield conda.plugins.CondaSubcommand(
        name="ascii-graph",
        summary="A subcommand that takes three coordinates and prints out an ascii graph",
        action=ascii_graph,
        )
```


## Packaging the custom subcommand

In order to install the `conda ascii-graph` subcommand we will need to configure a Python build system. You can either use the [PEP 621][pep 621] compliant `pyproject.toml` or the classic `setup.py`:

<details>
<summary><code>pyproject.toml</code></summary>

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0", "setuptools-scm"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "ascii-graph"
version = "1.0"
description = "My ascii graph subcommand plugin"
requires-python = ">=3.7"
dependencies = ["conda", "sympy"]

[tools.setuptools]
py_modules=["ascii_graph"]

[project.entry-points.conda]
ascii-graph = "ascii_graph"
```

> **Note:**
> #### `[build-system]`
> - `requires` This is a list of requirement specifiers for build-time dependencies of a package.
> - `build-backend` Build backends have the ability to accept configuration settings, which can change the way that the package building is handled.
> 
> #### `[project]`
> * `name` (required) This is the name of the package that contains your subcommand. This is also how others will find your subcommand package if you choose to upload it to PyPI.
> * `version` (required) The version of the project; can be specified *either* statically or listed as dynamic.
> `description` A brief description of the project.
> * `requires-python` The version(s) of Python required by your project.
> * `dependencies` These are all of the dependencies for your project. This specific subcommand example requires both `conda` and `art`, which is why they are both listed here.
>
> For more information on `pyproject.toml` see the [PyPA packaging documentation][pyproject.toml docs].

</details>

<details>
<summary><code>setup.py</code></summary>

```python
from setuptools import setup

setup(
    name="ascii-graph",
    version="1.0",
    description="My ascii graph subcommand plugin",
    python_requires=">=3.7",
    install_requires=["conda", "sympy"],
    py_modules=["ascii_graph"],
    entry_points={"conda": ["ascii-graph = ascii_graph"]},
)
```

> **Note:**
> * `name` This is the name of the package that contains your subcommand. This is also how others will find your subcommand package if you choose to upload it to PyPI.
> * `install_requires` These are all of the dependencies for your project. This should at a minimum always contain the version of `conda` for which your plugin is compatible with.
> * `entry_points` The entry point you list here is how `conda` will discover your plugin and should point to the file containing the `conda.plugins.register` hook. In our simple use case, it points to the `ascii_graph` module contained within the `ascii_graph.py` file. For more complex examples where your module is contained within a folder, it may look more like `my_module.main` or `my_modules.plugin_hooks`.
> * `py_modules` The `py_modules` variables lets `setup` know exactly where to look for all of the modules that comprise your plugin source code.
>
> For more information on `setup.py` see the [Python setup script documentation][setup.py docs].

</details>

> **Note:**
> For more information about entry points specification in general, please read [PyPA's entrypoints documentation][entrypoints docs].

### Development/Editable Install

The custom `ascii-graph` subcommand plugin can be installed as an editable install using either the `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py`:

```bash
$ python -m pip install --editable ./
```

### Conda Install

When you're ready to distribute your custom `ascii-graph` subcommand plugin you can package it as a conda package:

<details>
<summary><code>recipe/meta.yaml</code></summary>

```yaml
package:
  name: ascii-graph
  version: 1.0

source:
  path: ../

build:
  script: $PYTHON -m pip install --no-deps .

requirements:
  host:
    - python >=3.7

  run:
    - conda
    - python >=3.7
    - art

about:
  home: https://github.com/conda/conda-plugin-template
  license: BSD-3-Clause
  license_file: LICENSE
  summary: My ascii graph subcommand plugin
```

</details>

```bash
$ conda build ./recipe
```

## The subcommand output

Once the subcommand plugin is successfully installed or registered, the help text will display it as an additional option available from other packages:

```bash
$ conda --help
usage: conda [-h] [-V] command ...

conda is a tool for managing and deploying applications, environments and packages.

Options:

positional arguments:
command
   clean        Remove unused packages and caches.

[...output shortened...]

conda commands available from other packages:
ascii-graph - A subcommand that takes three coordinates and prints out an ascii graph

conda commands available from other packages (legacy):
content-trust
env
```

Running `conda ascii [three numbers/floats]` will result in the following output:

```bash
$ conda ascii-graph 3 -4 6.878


330 |                                                      .

```

Congratulations, you've just implemented your first custom `conda` subcommand plugin!
